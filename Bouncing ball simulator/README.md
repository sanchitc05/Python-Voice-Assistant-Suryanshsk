# ðŸŽ¾ Bouncing Ball Simulator

This project simulates the movement of balls bouncing within a container under the effect of gravity. The balls interact by bouncing off the walls and bottom of the container, creating a simple physics-based simulation.

## ðŸ”§ Prerequisites

This simulation runs on **Python 3** and requires the `pygame` module.

### Installation
Install the required dependencies by running:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Script

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing the script.
3. Run the following command:
```bash
python3 ball_bounce.py
```

## ðŸ“œ How It Works

The script uses `pygame` to create a container where the balls are affected by gravity, bounce off the walls, and interact with the environment.

### Features:

* Realistic gravity-based ball bouncing.
* Collision detection with the walls and container base.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

* `ball_bounce.py` - Main script that runs the simulation.
* `requirements.txt` - List of dependencies for the project.

### Enjoy watching the balls in action! ðŸŽ‰
